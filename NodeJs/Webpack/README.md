# tracetool

Send debug, warning, error traces to an external windows tracetool viewer (located on the bin folder). 

<img alt="Viewer" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capslock66/Tracetool/master/Server1.jpg">

You MUST start the viewer before sending traces.

You can send basic traces, 2 columns traces, hierachical traces, objects , call stack, image, dump,...
you can resend traces, create new pages on the viewer to separate business traces, Watches pages
There is a lot of functions to manages traces on the viewer : delete, bookmark, set as current,...

The Api is compatible with NodeJs and on a browser (using a script or requireJs), so you can see all your traces on the same computer.

Tracetool is also available for Java , Dot Net, Silverlight, C++ , Delphi, Python and any system compatible with ActiveX (windows)

**On the tracetool viewer, open the View/Options... menu, select the "framework" section , enable the HTTP port (used for javascript api) and give an UNUSED port like 81**
**This port need to be the same on your nodejs application**

You can enter a comment on the "TraceTool Title" in the "general" section , like "Tracetool - Http port : 81"
The viewer must be on a windows computer and your application on any system suporting nodejs like a raspberry Pi !

In your NodeJs Application, just give the Host and port before sending traces.

# Usage

```javascript
var ttrace = require('tracetool');
ttrace.host = '127.0.0.1:81';   // note that the default is already 127.0.0.1:81
ttrace.debug.send('hello', 'world') ;
ttrace.debug.send('Parent trace').send('Child trace') ;
```
